# CONVERSION_NOTES.md

The following conversion notes are provided to assist 
in the conversion of the app from `three.js` to `react-three-fiber` and `drei`

## Console Component
**The following was output by chatGPT w/ attached docs from the relevant libraries.**

------------------------

To convert this code to use `react-three-fiber` and `drei`, you would need to create a `React` component that uses `CanvasTexture` from `drei`.

Here's how you could do it:

```js
import React, { useRef, useEffect } from 'react';
import { CanvasTexture } from '@react-three/drei';

function ConsoleTexture({ width, height, text }) {
  // Create a ref to store the canvas element
  const canvasRef = useRef();

  // Use the useEffect hook to perform side effects
  useEffect(() => {
    // Get the canvas element from the ref
    const canvas = canvasRef.current;

    // Get the 2D rendering context from the canvas
    const context = canvas.getContext('2d');

    // Set the fill style to black
    context.fillStyle = '#000';

    // Fill the entire canvas with the fill style
    context.fillRect(0, 0, width, height);

    // Set the font style and color for the text
    context.font = 'bold 24px Menlo,Lucida Console,Courier New';
    context.fillStyle = '#fff';

    // Draw the text on the canvas at position (20, 40)
    context.fillText(text, 20, 40);

    // Create a new texture from the canvas
    const texture = new CanvasTexture(canvas);

    // Mark the texture as needing an update
    texture.needsUpdate = true;

    // Return a cleanup function to dispose of the texture
    // when the component unmounts
    return () => {
      texture.dispose();
    };
  }, [width, height, text]); // Run effect whenever width, height, or text changes

  // Render a hidden canvas element
  return (
    <canvas
      ref={canvasRef}
      width={width}
      height={height}
      style={{ display: 'none' }} />
  )
}

// Export the ConsoleTexture component
export default ConsoleTexture;
```

## Index.html Application

------------------------

I have been trying to get chatGPT to spit out code for the main application but it does not seem to want to co-operate. It keeps spitting back boilerplate code that is unrelated to the code here.
